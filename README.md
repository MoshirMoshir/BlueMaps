# BlueMaps
BlueMaps is an interactive map of the Blue Hole from Dave the Diver!
Navigate your way from the Shallows to the Depths and also find points of interests with ease!

## !!! Announcement !!!
I am extremely busy and don't have the free time to actively work on this project. <br>
I will do my best to update it from time to time; it would be very appreciated if you can provide any help: <br>
Currently I need to compile all the locations of points of interests such as Sharks, Fish, Items, etc <br>
If anyone is able to provide a clearer map OR have the art skills to colorize/beutify the current ones that'd be lit uwu <br> <br>
If you would like to help or get in contact with me, join the official [Dave the Diver Discord](https://discord.com/invite/davethediver) and check out the [BlueMaps discussion page](https://discord.com/channels/977061952960462848/1128284887472930888)

The Site is still in development but planned features are:

 - [x] High quality 2d unrendered versions of every map obtained and uploaded
 - [x] Usablity on mobile
 - [x] Created groundwork code for overlays
 - [x] Add groundwork/code of overlays
 - [x] Update Maps to be less cluttered
 - [ ] Add Shark Overlay
 - [x] Add Escape Pod Overlay
 - [ ] Add Fish Overlay
 - [ ] Add Items Overlay
 - [ ] Add additional pages exclusive to each depth
 - [ ] Make the Main Map page prettier and overhaul Website UI
 - [ ] Add pages where you can find more information about fish, mission locations, etc (mini-wiki)
 - [ ] Stitching together or obtaining high quality rendered versions of every map (This is extremely tedious and will probably not happen unless someone else does it)
 - [ ] More features TBD

> This project was inspired by KlinkerKlank's original efforts in making a map which can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2921898835)
> I have since removed easy access of his map from the site as I am working on the features that will outclass his original map, but you can still find it [here](https://bluemaps.moshir.dev/klinkerklank.html)
