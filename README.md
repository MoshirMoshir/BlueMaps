BlueMaps is an interactive map of the Blue Hole from Dave the Diver!

## !!! Announcement !!!
Due to personal obligations, I must put this project on hold for the remainder of the month. I will be back in August and am looking forward to flushing out my feature list and making a super awesome map!
It would be very appreciated if you can provide any help; Ideally locations of points of interests will be compiled by the time I get back so I can just add the markers to the map uwu
Once again, if you would like to help, join the official Dave the Diver Discord and check out the [discussion page](https://discord.com/channels/977061952960462848/1128284887472930888)

It is currently a work-in-progress but planned features are:

 - [x] High quality 2d unrendered versions of every map obtained and uploaded
 - [x] Usablity on mobile
 - [ ] Adding overlays for where sharks, fishes, and other creatures can spawn
 - [ ] Adding additional pages exclusive to each depth
 - [ ] Adding pages where you can find more information about fish, mission locations, etc (mini-wiki)
 - [ ] Stitching together or obtaining high quality rendered versions of every map
 - [ ] More features TBD
